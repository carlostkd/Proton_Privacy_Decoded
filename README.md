## Known Issues that you shouldt report to me:

- :shipit: Account Creation date refers only to the date of the Encrypted Key

```
The user can have more email addresss or change the key every day?? :)
You should compare with "traces" or do a more extensive OSINT.
```
```
    That's it!
```
    





- :shipit: For some weird reason if you abuse from ProtonMail API the API always returns all queried emails as True even if the Email is not a ProtonMail Email.
```
do not abuse and everything runs fine
```

- :shipit: IP Address City Region Country etc returns values as "None"
```
reason 1 -The script uses a public api from ipapi with a limit of 30.000 queries a month
reason 2 -If you are using some vpn its possible that your vpn IP are blacklisted
```
- :shipit: solution
```
Use another api 
Change your VPN IP
```
